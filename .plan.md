# Implementation Plan: Fix Job Processor Health Check Bug

## Problem
The System Health dashboard shows "Degraded" status because the Job Processor health check reports "not initialized" even when the processor is running. This is a false negative caused by an import-time binding bug.

## Root Cause
In `backend/app/services/health_checker.py`:
- Line 19 imports `_processor_instance` at module load time: `from app.workers.job_processor import _processor_instance`
- This creates a reference to the initial `None` value
- When `job_processor.py` later updates the global variable via `start_job_processor()`, the imported reference in `health_checker.py` doesn't update
- The health check at lines 244-251 always sees `None`

## Solution
Change from importing the variable to importing the module, then reference the variable through the module. This ensures we always see the current global state.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Fix the import in health_checker.py
**File:** `backend/app/services/health_checker.py`
**Change line 19 from:**
```python
from app.workers.job_processor import _processor_instance
```
**To:**
```python
import app.workers.job_processor as job_processor
```

### Step 2: Update the health check function
**File:** `backend/app/services/health_checker.py`
**Change lines 244-251 from:**
```python
if _processor_instance is None:
    response_time = (time.time() - start_time) * 1000
    return HealthCheck(
        status="down",
        priority="high",
        message="Job processor not initialized",
        response_time_ms=response_time
    )
```
**To:**
```python
if job_processor._processor_instance is None:
    response_time = (time.time() - start_time) * 1000
    return HealthCheck(
        status="down",
        priority="high",
        message="Job processor not initialized",
        response_time_ms=response_time
    )
```

### Step 3: Update the running check
**File:** `backend/app/services/health_checker.py`
**Change line 255 from:**
```python
if not _processor_instance.is_running:
```
**To:**
```python
if not job_processor._processor_instance.is_running:
```

### Step 4: Deploy and test
1. Commit the changes
2. Deploy to Railway
3. Wait for deployment to complete
4. Use Playwright to test the System Health dashboard
5. Verify status shows "Healthy" instead of "Degraded"
6. Verify Job Processor shows green checkmark instead of red error

## Expected Outcome
After this fix, the health check will correctly detect when the Job Processor is initialized and running, and the System Health dashboard will show "Healthy" status.

## Testing Strategy
1. Check backend logs to confirm Job Processor is running
2. Call `/api/health` endpoint directly to see raw health check response
3. Use Playwright to screenshot the System Health dashboard
4. Verify all components show correct status
