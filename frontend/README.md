## Key Features

### Counties Page
- View all configured counties with status indicators
- Add new counties with 3-step wizard (name → credentials → test)
- Pull permits with date range or "older than X years" filters
- Visual status: Connected, Token Expired, Error

### Leads Page
- Table view with filtering by county and sync status
- Checkbox selection for batch operations
- Send selected leads to Summit.AI
- Sync status badges: Pending, Synced, Failed

### Settings Page
- Configure Summit.AI API credentials
- Test connection before saving
- API key masking for security

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the FastAPI backend using REST endpoints:

- `GET/POST /api/counties` - County management
- `POST /api/counties/{id}/pull-permits` - Pull permits from Accela
- `GET /api/leads` - Fetch leads with filters
- `POST /api/leads/sync-to-summit` - Sync leads to Summit.AI
- `GET/PUT /api/summit/config` - Summit.AI configuration

## Development

The app uses React Query for data fetching and caching. All API calls are wrapped in custom hooks for easy state management.

### Adding a New API Endpoint

1. Add the API call to the appropriate file in `src/api/`
2. Create or update a React Query hook in `src/hooks/`
3. Use the hook in your component

Example:
```javascript
// In component
const { data, isLoading, error } = useCounties();
```

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The production build will be in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment to Vercel or any static hosting service.
